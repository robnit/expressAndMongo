# Bird API



**Objective:** Refresh the tired neurons holding onto express/mongo knowledge, atrophied by 2 years of exclusive React devving

Normally I would write tests for an api. This was strictly an exercise to remind myself how this stuff works. I swear I'm not a careless monster



## Installation





1. Clone
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`




## How to Use



1. Hit the endpoints found in `src/routes/routes.js` and make/unmake some birds



2.  That's it
